Of course. Let's do a deep dive into the User Manager, focusing specifically on the Profile and Settings workflows. You are right to question when to use an RPC versus a standard client callâ€”this is a key architectural decision.

Here is the detailed breakdown.

### **Application Logic Blueprint: The User Manager**

**Core Responsibility:** Manages the data and state related to an individual, authenticated user's profile and application settings.

---

### **1. Profile Management Workflow**

This workflow handles how a user views and updates their public-facing profile information (name, bio, etc.).

#### **Step 1: Viewing the Profile Data**

*   **User Action:** Navigates to their profile page.
*   **Application Logic:**
    1.  The `UserProfile` component mounts.
    2.  It calls a TanStack Query hook, `useFetchUserProfile()`.
    3.  This hook triggers the data fetching function.
*   **Database Interaction: RPC is Necessary**
    *   **Why?:** The profile view is an *aggregation* of data from multiple tables. You need the user's bio from `profiles`, their teams from `team_members`, their active plan from `session_logs`, etc. Fetching this with individual client calls would create a slow "waterfall" of network requests.
    *   **Implementation:** The data fetching function calls a single, powerful RPC.
        ```javascript
        // In your endpoint file
        const fetchProfileData = (userId) => {
          return supabase.rpc('get_user_profile_details', { p_user_id: userId });
        }
        ```
    *   **RPC Name:** `get_user_profile_details(user_id TEXT)`
        *   **Responsibility:** As designed before, this function joins `profiles`, `team_members`, `session_logs`, and `plans` to return a single, clean JSON object with all the required data. This is the only "read" operation needed for the profile view.

#### **Step 2: Entering and Managing "Edit Mode"**

*   **User Action:** Clicks the "Edit Profile" button.
*   **Application Logic:**
    1.  This is **purely client-side state management.** No database call is needed.
    2.  A state variable, like `const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false)`, is toggled to `true`.
    3.  The UI conditionally renders input fields instead of plain text, populated with the data already fetched in Step 1.
    4.  The user's changes are tracked in a local form state (e.g., using `useState` or a form library like React Hook Form).

#### **Step 3: Submitting the Profile Changes**

*   **User Action:** Clicks the "Save" button.
*   **Application Logic:**
    1.  The `onSubmit` handler for the form is triggered.
    2.  It calls a TanStack `useMutation` hook to send the updated profile data to the database.
*   **Database Interaction: RPC is Recommended**
    *   **Why?:** While you *could* use a simple `supabase.from('profiles').update(...)`, an RPC provides a more robust and secure "API layer". It allows you to add server-side validation (e.g., checking for invalid characters in a name) and ensures you are only updating specific, allowed columns. It's a more scalable pattern.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```javascript
        // In your TanStack useMutation hook
        const updateUserMutation = useMutation({
          mutationFn: (profileUpdates) => supabase.rpc('update_user_profile', profileUpdates),
          onSuccess: () => {
            // This is crucial for updating the UI
            queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['profiles', 'detail', userId] });
          }
        });
        ```
    *   **RPC Name:** `update_user_profile(full_name TEXT, bio TEXT, ...)`
        *   **Responsibility:** Takes the new profile data as arguments. It runs an `UPDATE` query on the `profiles` table for the currently authenticated user (`auth.uid()`). It should only update the fields that are passed as arguments.

### **2. Settings Management Workflow**

This workflow is simpler and handles non-public settings, like the user's preferred unit of measurement.

#### **Step 1: Viewing Current Settings**

*   **User Action:** Navigates to the "Settings" page.
*   **Application Logic:**
    1.  The `SettingsPage` component needs to fetch the user's current settings.
*   **Database Interaction: Simple Client Call is Sufficient**
    *   **Why?:** The primary setting, `unit`, is a single column in the `profiles` table. There is no complex aggregation needed. A direct, lightweight query is more efficient than calling a large RPC that fetches unnecessary data.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```javascript
        // In your TanStack useQuery hook
        const useFetchUserSettings = (userId) => {
          return useQuery({
            queryKey: ['users', userId, 'settings'],
            queryFn: async () => {
              const { data, error } = await supabase
                .from('profiles')
                .select('unit, username') // Select only what you need
                .eq('id', userId)
                .single();
              if (error) throw error;
              return data;
            }
          });
        }
        ```

#### **Step 2: Changing a Setting**

*   **User Action:** Toggles the unit switch from "Metric" to "Imperial".
*   **Application Logic:**
    1.  The `onChange` event of the toggle/dropdown triggers a `useMutation` hook immediately. There is no "edit mode" or "save" button for simple settings.
    2.  The mutation's job is to update the single field in the database.
*   **Database Interaction: Simple Client Call is Best**
    *   **Why?:** This is a trivial update of one column in one table. An RPC here would be over-engineering. A standard client call is perfectly clean, readable, and secure with the right RLS policy.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```javascript
        // In your TanStack useMutation hook
        const updateUnitMutation = useMutation({
          mutationFn: (newUnit) => supabase
            .from('profiles')
            .update({ unit: newUnit })
            .eq('id', userId),
          onSuccess: (updatedData) => {
            // Update global state and invalidate the settings query
            setUnitPreferenceInGlobalState(updatedData.unit);
            queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['users', userId, 'settings'] });
          }
        });
        ```
    *   **RLS Policy (Crucial for Security):**
        *   You need a policy on the `profiles` table that allows a user to update a row *only if* their authenticated `uid` matches the `id` of that row. This prevents a user from changing another user's settings.

### **Summary: RPCs vs. Client Calls for the User Manager**

| Task                        | Recommended Method      | Justification                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fetch Profile Data**      | **RPC** (`get_user_profile_details`) | **Aggregation.** Data comes from many tables; one RPC is far more efficient than multiple client calls. |
| **Update Profile Data**     | **RPC** (`update_user_profile`)      | **Security & Scalability.** Creates a controlled API layer for validation and future complex updates. |
| **Fetch Settings Data**     | **Client Call** (`select`) | **Simplicity & Efficiency.** A lightweight query for a few columns from a single table. No aggregation needed. |
| **Update a Single Setting** | **Client Call** (`update`) | **Simplicity.** A trivial, single-column update. An RPC would be unnecessary overhead. Secured by RLS.    |
