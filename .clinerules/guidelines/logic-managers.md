Of course. My apologies for the previous broad answers. You are right to demand a more concrete, actionable blueprint that maps directly to your tech stack.

Let's define the application logic for the four managers you specified. This structure is designed to be clean, modular, and perfectly suited for a Vite/React/TanStack/Supabase architecture. Each "manager" can be thought of as a feature module in your application's source code.

Here is the blueprint in the requested format.

### **Application Logic Blueprint: The Four Managers**

This document outlines the core responsibilities, workflows, and required Supabase RPC functions for each of the four primary application logic layers.

---

### **1. The User Manager**

*   **Core Responsibility:** Manages the data and state related to an individual, authenticated user, including their profile, settings, and initial onboarding.

*   **Application Workflows & Logic:**
    1.  **Onboarding Workflow:** A multi-step process triggered on a user's first login. It guides them through setting their initial goals and experience level, culminating in a call to action to select their first plan. This manager holds the state for the current onboarding step.
    2.  **Profile Management Workflow:** Handles the logic for a user fetching their own profile data, entering an "edit mode," submitting changes, and seeing the updated information.
    3.  **Settings Management Workflow:** A simple workflow for updating user-specific settings, most importantly the 'metric' vs. 'imperial' unit preference. This manager's logic ensures that once this setting is changed, all relevant data displays are converted app-wide.

*   **Required Supabase RPC Functions:**
    *   `get_user_profile_details(user_id TEXT)`: Fetches the aggregated profile data we designed earlier (profile info, teams, active plan, etc.).
    *   `update_user_profile(full_name TEXT, bio TEXT, etc.)`: A function that updates the user's record in the `profiles` table. It's more secure than allowing direct table writes.

### **2. The Team Manager**

*   **Core Responsibility:** Manages the creation, modification, and interactions within teams. It enforces the roles and permissions of coaches and clients.

*   **Application Workflows & Logic:**
    1.  **Team Creation Workflow:** A user fills out a form. The logic calls a single RPC that creates the `teams` record and simultaneously adds the creator to `team_members` with an "admin" or "coach" role.
    2.  **Invitation Workflow:**
        *   A coach initiates an invite. The logic creates a pending record in a `team_invitations` table.
        *   The invited user sees the pending invite. Their action (accept/decline) triggers a function that either creates a new `team_members` record (on accept) or simply deletes the invitation.
    3.  **Plan Assignment Workflow (Coach-side):** A coach selects a client and a plan. The logic calls an RPC that forks the plan (creates a copy) and links it to the client, setting an optional start date.
    4.  **Client Progress Review Workflow (Coach-side):** A coach navigates to a client's page. The logic calls a permission-protected RPC to fetch that specific client's workout history and progress data. The logic **must** ensure the requesting user is a coach in the same team.

*   **Required Supabase RPC Functions:**
    *   `create_team_with_owner(team_name TEXT, ...)`: Creates a team and assigns the creator as the owner in a single transaction.
    *   `get_team_details_and_members(team_id UUID)`: Fetches team info and a list of all its members and their roles.
    *   `assign_team_plan_to_member(...)`: The plan assignment function we discussed.
    *   `get_client_progress_for_coach(client_user_id UUID)`: A secure function that first verifies the caller's permission, then returns the client's workout history.

---

### **3. The Workout Manager**

*   **Core Responsibility:** Manages the entire lifecycle of a workout for an individual user, from starting a session based on a plan, to logging performed sets, to completing and viewing the historical record.

*   **Application Workflows & Logic:**
    1.  **Session Initiation Workflow:** A user selects a workout from their plan and hits "Start." The logic's first action is to call an RPC to create the initial `session_logs` record. The `session_log_id` returned from this call becomes the key for the entire live workout session.
    2.  **Live Workout Logging Workflow:** This is the core "in-workout" experience. The user fills in their reps/weight for a set and hits "Save." The logic sends this data, along with the active `session_log_id`, to be saved as a new `set_logs` record. This manager holds the complete state of the currently active workout on the client-side.
    3.  **Session Completion Workflow:** The user hits "Finish Workout." The logic makes a final call to update the `session_logs` record with the total duration and any user notes. The local "live workout" state is then cleared.
    4.  **History Review Workflow:** A user views a past workout. The logic calls an RPC that fetches both the performed data (`session_log` and its `set_logs`) and the originally planned data (`plan_session` and its sets), allowing the UI to present a "Planned vs. Performed" comparison.

*   **Required Supabase RPC Functions:**
    *   `start_session_log(plan_session_id UUID)`: Creates the initial log entry and returns its new `id`.
    *   `get_workout_log_details_with_plan_comparison(log_id UUID)`: Fetches both the performed and planned data for a specific historical workout.
    *   (Note: Individual `set_logs` can often be handled by a simple `supabase.from('set_logs').insert(...)` call from the client, as long as RLS policies are secure. An RPC isn't strictly necessary for every set.)

### **4. The Explore Manager**

*   **Core Responsibility:** Powers the public-facing discovery pages. It handles the logic for searching, filtering, and displaying plans, professional teams, and coaches.

*   **Application Workflows & Logic:**
    1.  **Filtering Workflow:** This is the primary workflow. A user interacts with filter UI elements (dropdowns, search bars). The manager updates its internal state object that holds all active filters. This state change automatically triggers a `useQuery` refetch from TanStack Query, passing the new filter state to the appropriate RPC function.
    2.  **Curation & Ranking Workflow:** The logic within the RPC functions themselves will handle the curation. For example, the function for discovering teams will be hardcoded to first query for "Pro" tier teams, then other public teams. The function for plans will be coded to rank results by a popularity score. The client-side logic simply calls the function and displays the ordered results it receives.
    3.  **Detail View Workflow:** A user clicks on a plan or team from the explore list. The application navigates to a detail page, and the logic uses the ID from the URL to fetch the detailed information for that specific item (e.g., a plan with all its weeks, days, and exercises).

*   **Required Supabase RPC Functions:**
    *   `get_filtered_plans(...)`: The powerful, multi-filter function for discovering plans.
    *   `get_discoverable_teams()`: Fetches all public teams, prioritizing and flagging "Pro" tier teams.
    *   `get_discoverable_coaches()`: Fetches all users who are coaches within public, "Pro" tier teams to populate a directory.
